__Product Characteristic:__

Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) wire achieves high voltage protection due to the excellent dielectric properties of FEP and therefore has smaller diameters than other high voltage wires.  FEP also has a high stress crack resistance and retains its toughness and flexibility even at higher temperatures up to 200°C.  This wire is very resistant to chemicals including transformer oils.  It has a low coefficient of friction, low flammability, negligible moisture absorption, and excellent resistance to ozone sunlight and weather.

FEP is also a non-hygroscopic fluoropolymer used for critical physiological and medical applications where small diameters, long flex-life and non-toxic insulations are of primary consideration. It’s designed for long usage in flow probes and pressure measuring instruments. It also withstands severe, repeated flexing in very high and low temperatures.

UL1330 and UL 1332 wire is suitable for use as internal wiring in appliances such as ovens, also in auto headlamps, mercury switches, computers and motor leads. Also suitable for immersion in gasoline; gasoline vapor; and 80°C in oil.
